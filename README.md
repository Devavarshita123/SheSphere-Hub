# 🌸 SheSphere – A Collaborative Ecosystem for Women Empowerment

## Phase 1: Requirement Analysis
## Problem Statement

Women across the world face significant barriers when it comes to collaboration, networking, and community leadership. Existing women empowerment platforms like SHEROES, POPxo, and Safetipin have contributed to awareness and connection, yet they remain fragmented in addressing women’s holistic empowerment journey — from learning to leadership.
Current platforms often:
Lack advanced collaboration tools that allow women leaders to create and manage their own events or webinars.
Provide limited privacy controls and anonymity, discouraging participation on sensitive topics.
Miss robust mentorship matching, skill-based networking, and structured role-based communities.
Do not integrate AI-powered safety, local discovery, or economic empowerment tools (like women-led marketplaces).
As a result, women — especially those in smaller towns or underrepresented groups — miss opportunities to connect, learn, and grow together safely and confidently.

## Vision
To create a comprehensive, inclusive, and intelligent digital ecosystem where every woman — from child to elder — can connect, collaborate, learn, and lead without barriers.
SheSphere envisions becoming the Google-scale community platform for women empowerment, blending the best of technology, empathy, and social design.

## Mission
Enable every woman to create, host, and manage her own webinars, workshops, or mentorship circles.
Build a safe, AI-moderated environment that supports both identity-based and anonymous participation.
Integrate mentorship, learning, and marketplace ecosystems within one seamless experience.
Use data-driven insights and cloud microservices to ensure scalability, personalization, and security.
Connect women locally and globally through geo-based discovery and events.

## Phase 2:Functional Requirements + Core Features
🧩 1. User-Facing Modules (Frontend Functional Requirements)
Task:
Identify what the system must do — i.e., the major functional requirements (FRs) and the core modules (microservices) that will make up SheSphere.
We’ll think in two layers:
User-facing modules (visible features)
System-facing services (backend brains)
